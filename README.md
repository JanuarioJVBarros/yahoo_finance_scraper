## INTRINSIC VALUE

### Intrinsic Value of a Stock: Understanding the DCF Model

The intrinsic value of a stock represents its true worth based on fundamental analysis, rather than market price fluctuations. One of the most widely used methods to determine intrinsic value is the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model.

Formula for Intrinsic Value Using the DCF Model
$$𝐼𝑉=∑𝐶𝐹𝑡(1+𝑟)𝑡+𝑇𝑉(1+𝑟)𝑛$$
 
where:

IV = Intrinsic Value

𝐶𝐹𝑡= Expected future cash flow in year 
r = Discount rate (typically the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC))
t = Time period (years)
TV = Terminal Value (estimated value of cash flows beyond the forecast period)

The Terminal Value (TV) is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model:

$$𝑇𝑉=𝐹𝐶𝐹𝑛×(1+𝑔)𝑟−𝑔$$
 
where:

𝐹𝐶𝐹𝑛 = Free Cash Flow in the final forecasted year
g = Growth rate of cash flows beyond the forecast period
r = Discount rate
n = Number of forecasted years

### Steps to Calculate Intrinsic Value
Estimate Future Cash Flows – Analyze past financial data to project future Free Cash Flows (FCF).

Determine the Discount Rate (r) – Typically the company’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is used.

Calculate the Present Value (PV) of Cash Flows – Discount each year's expected cash flow to its present value.

Calculate the Terminal Value (TV) – Estimate the business's value beyond the forecast period using the Gordon Growth Model.

Sum the Present Values – Add up the present values of all discounted cash flows plus the present value of the terminal value.

Determine Intrinsic Value Per Share – Divide the total intrinsic value by the number of outstanding shares:

𝐼𝑉per share = 𝐼𝑉 / Outstanding Shares

## ROE
### Return on Equity (ROE) Calculation
ROE (Return on Equity) is a key metric Warren Buffett uses to evaluate a company's profitability and efficiency in generating returns for shareholders.

$$𝑅𝑂𝐸 = (Net Income / Shareholders’ Equity) × 100$$

where:

Net Income = Company's profit after expenses and taxes
Shareholders' Equity = Total assets minus total liabilities

Buffett's Criteria for a "Good" ROE
✅ ROE consistently above 15% for at least 10 years
✅ A steady or increasing trend (shows strong management and profitability)
✅ Avoid companies with declining or erratic ROE

## D/E
### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
The Debt-to-Equity Ratio measures a company's financial leverage and how much debt it uses to finance its operations compared to shareholders' equity.

$$𝐷/𝐸 = Total Debt / Shareholders’ Equity$$
 
where:

Total Debt = Short-term debt + Long-term debt
Shareholders' Equity = Total assets minus total liabilities

Buffett's Criteria for a "Good" Debt-to-Equity Ratio
✅ D/E < 0.5 → Safe Investment (Company relies more on equity than debt)
⚠️ D/E between 0.5 - 1.0 → Moderate Risk (Debt is manageable but needs monitoring)
❌ D/E > 1.0 → Risky, High Debt (Company is highly leveraged, a red flag for Buffett)


# Profit Margins

Understanding Profit Margins
Buffett prefers companies with high and stable profit margins because they indicate:
✅ Strong pricing power (customers willing to pay more)
✅ Efficient cost management
✅ Long-term competitive advantage

There are two main profit margin types:

1. Gross Profit Margin
Formula:

Gross Margin
=
Revenue
−
Cost of Goods Sold
Revenue
×
100
Gross Margin= 
Revenue
Revenue−Cost of Goods Sold
​
 ×100
Why it matters: Measures how efficiently a company produces its goods.

Net Profit Margin (Most Important for Buffett)
Formula:

Net Margin
=
Net Income
Revenue
×
100
Net Margin= 
Revenue
Net Income
​
 ×100
Why it matters: Shows how much profit remains after all expenses, taxes, and debt payments.

Buffett’s Benchmark: Stable or increasing Net Margin > 10% over several years.

# MOAT 
Identifying a Strong Moat
A company has a moat if it shows:
✅ High & stable Gross Margins (Pricing power & efficiency)
✅ Consistent Revenue Growth (Demand for products/services)
✅ High R&D Spending (if applicable) (Innovation & tech leadership)
✅ Strong Brand Power (Not directly measurable, but can check P/E ratio vs. competitors)


# Metrics to Evaluate Management (Quantitative)
1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)
Free Cash Flow is the cash a company generates after capital expenditures. It’s a good measure of whether the company is creating value for shareholders.

Formula:

FCF
=
Operating Cash Flow
−
Capital Expenditures
FCF=Operating Cash Flow−Capital Expenditures
2. Insider Ownership and Executive Compensation
Insider Ownership: Buffett likes to see executives and directors owning a significant portion of the company’s stock because it aligns their interests with those of other shareholders.

# POE
PE Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)
The Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio) is one of the most commonly used metrics to evaluate whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. It’s a simple way to compare the market price of a company's stock to its earnings.

How the PE Ratio is Calculated:
𝑃
𝐸
 
𝑅
𝑎
𝑡
𝑖
𝑜
=
Stock Price
Earnings Per Share (EPS)
PE Ratio= 
Earnings Per Share (EPS)
Stock Price
​
 
Where:

Stock Price: The current price of one share of the company.
