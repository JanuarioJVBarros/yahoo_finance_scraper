The intrinsic value of a stock is an estimate of its true worth, based on fundamental analysis rather than market price fluctuations. There are several ways to calculate intrinsic value, but one of the most common methods is the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model.

Formula for Intrinsic Value using DCF Model:
𝐼𝑉 = (∑𝐶𝐹𝑡 / ((1+𝑟)𝑡)) + (𝑇𝑉/(1+𝑟))
​
where:
IV = Intrinsic Value

CFt= Expected future cash flows in year 
r = Discount rate (usually Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC)
t = Time period (years)
TV = Terminal Value (estimated value beyond the forecast period)
𝑇𝑉 = (𝐹𝐶𝐹𝑛×(1+𝑔)) / (𝑟−𝑔)
n = Number of years in the forecast period

Steps to Calculate Intrinsic Value:
Estimate Future Cash Flows – Use past financial data to project future free cash flows (FCF).

Determine the Discount Rate (r) – Typically the company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

Calculate the Present Value (PV) of Cash Flows – Discount each year's expected cash flow to the present.
​
where 
g is the growth rate of cash flows beyond the forecast period.
Sum the Present Values – Add up the present values of all cash flows plus the present value of the terminal value.

Example Calculation:
Let’s assume:

Projected Free Cash Flow for the next 3 years: $100M, $120M, $140M

Discount rate (r) = 10%

Growth rate (g) = 4%
 
After calculating, the Intrinsic Value is obtained.
