# INTRINSIC VALUE
The intrinsic value of a stock is an estimate of its true worth, based on fundamental analysis rather than market price fluctuations. There are several ways to calculate intrinsic value, but one of the most common methods is the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model.

Formula for Intrinsic Value using DCF Model:
𝐼𝑉 = (∑𝐶𝐹𝑡 / ((1+𝑟)𝑡)) + (𝑇𝑉/(1+𝑟))
​
where:
IV = Intrinsic Value

CFt= Expected future cash flows in year 
r = Discount rate (usually Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC)
t = Time period (years)
TV = Terminal Value (estimated value beyond the forecast period)
𝑇𝑉 = (𝐹𝐶𝐹𝑛×(1+𝑔)) / (𝑟−𝑔)
n = Number of years in the forecast period

Steps to Calculate Intrinsic Value:
Estimate Future Cash Flows – Use past financial data to project future free cash flows (FCF).

Determine the Discount Rate (r) – Typically the company's Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

Calculate the Present Value (PV) of Cash Flows – Discount each year's expected cash flow to the present.
​
where 
g is the growth rate of cash flows beyond the forecast period.
Sum the Present Values – Add up the present values of all cash flows plus the present value of the terminal value.

Example Calculation:
Let’s assume:

Projected Free Cash Flow for the next 3 years: $100M, $120M, $140M

Discount rate (r) = 10%

Growth rate (g) = 4%
 
After calculating, the Intrinsic Value is obtained.

# ROE
Understanding ROE
Formula:

𝑅
𝑂
𝐸
=
Net Income
Shareholder’s Equity
ROE= 
Shareholder’s Equity
Net Income
​
 
Ideal ROE: Buffett prefers companies with consistent ROE above 15% over at least 10 years.

Why it Matters: A high ROE indicates a company is efficiently generating profits using its equity.

# Debt-to-Equity Ratio
Understanding Debt-to-Equity Ratio
Formula:

Debt-to-Equity
=
Total Debt
Stockholders Equity
Debt-to-Equity= 
Stockholders Equity
Total Debt
​
 
Ideal Range: Buffett prefers companies with low or manageable debt, typically a Debt-to-Equity ratio below 0.5 (or 50%).

Why It Matters:

High debt can make a company vulnerable in economic downturns.

A low ratio indicates financial stability and lower risk.


# Profit Margins

Understanding Profit Margins
Buffett prefers companies with high and stable profit margins because they indicate:
✅ Strong pricing power (customers willing to pay more)
✅ Efficient cost management
✅ Long-term competitive advantage

There are two main profit margin types:

1. Gross Profit Margin
Formula:

Gross Margin
=
Revenue
−
Cost of Goods Sold
Revenue
×
100
Gross Margin= 
Revenue
Revenue−Cost of Goods Sold
​
 ×100
Why it matters: Measures how efficiently a company produces its goods.

Net Profit Margin (Most Important for Buffett)
Formula:

Net Margin
=
Net Income
Revenue
×
100
Net Margin= 
Revenue
Net Income
​
 ×100
Why it matters: Shows how much profit remains after all expenses, taxes, and debt payments.

Buffett’s Benchmark: Stable or increasing Net Margin > 10% over several years.

# MOAT 
Identifying a Strong Moat
A company has a moat if it shows:
✅ High & stable Gross Margins (Pricing power & efficiency)
✅ Consistent Revenue Growth (Demand for products/services)
✅ High R&D Spending (if applicable) (Innovation & tech leadership)
✅ Strong Brand Power (Not directly measurable, but can check P/E ratio vs. competitors)


# Metrics to Evaluate Management (Quantitative)
1. Free Cash Flow (FCF)
Free Cash Flow is the cash a company generates after capital expenditures. It’s a good measure of whether the company is creating value for shareholders.

Formula:

FCF
=
Operating Cash Flow
−
Capital Expenditures
FCF=Operating Cash Flow−Capital Expenditures
2. Insider Ownership and Executive Compensation
Insider Ownership: Buffett likes to see executives and directors owning a significant portion of the company’s stock because it aligns their interests with those of other shareholders.

# POE
PE Ratio (Price-to-Earnings Ratio)
The Price-to-Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio) is one of the most commonly used metrics to evaluate whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. It’s a simple way to compare the market price of a company's stock to its earnings.

How the PE Ratio is Calculated:

Stock Price: The current price of one share of the company.
